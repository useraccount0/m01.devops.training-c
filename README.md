# DevOps Course M01: C Project

This is a simple C project demonstrating basic CI/CD steps:

- **Build:** Compiling source files into an executable.
- **Unit Testing:** Running tests to validate functionality.
- **Linting:** Running static analysis (using cppcheck) to catch potential issues.

## Directory Structure
